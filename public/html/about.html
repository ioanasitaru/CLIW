                        <b>ASLE</b> (Asian Language Learner) is an application designed to help you learn to write and speak various Asian languages
                        (e.g. Mandarin, Japanese, Korean etc.) by helping you practice writing, increase your vocabulary and many other
                        linguistic skills. The cornerstone of this application is its ability to adapt to your needs, as you can easily
                        adjust which modules you would like to see and train with. Using the provided template, any developer can contribute
                        to the module list, thus helping it expand even further.
